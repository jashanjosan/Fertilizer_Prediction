Abstract
•	This project develops a machine learning-based web application to predict optimal fertilizers for farmers.
•	It utilizes parameters like soil conditions, crop type, and environmental factors.
•	The goal is to increase agricultural productivity and minimize resource wastage.
•	The solution integrates predictive analytics with a user-friendly web interface.
Introduction
•	Agriculture significantly depends on informed decision-making regarding fertilizer usage.
•	Misuse of fertilizers affects crop yield and the environment.
•	This project offers a recommendation system leveraging machine learning to suggest fertilizers, aiding sustainable farming practices.
•	The system bridges technology with rural farmers' needs.
Methodology
•	Data Collection: Acquired soil and environmental data from agricultural datasets.
•	Feature Engineering: Prepared inputs like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and more.
•	Model Training: Trained a classifier using labeled fertilizer data.
•	Web Application: Built with Flask for accessible deployment.
Software Used
•	Python: Core programming language.
•	Flask: For building the web application.
•	Scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
•	Pickle: For saving and loading trained models.
•	HTML/CSS: For web front-end.
Experimental Results
•	Achieved high accuracy in fertilizer classification.
•	Demonstrated effective predictions based on test inputs.
•	Usability tests indicated the app's potential to improve farming decisions.
Conclusion
•	The project successfully recommends fertilizers based on user-inputted parameters.
•	It offers a scalable solution to enhance farming efficiency and productivity.
•	The integration of predictive analytics simplifies decision-making for farmers.
Future Scope
•	Integration: Incorporate additional parameters like real-time weather updates.
•	Localization: Add regional language support for wider adoption.
